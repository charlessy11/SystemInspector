## Test 10: Counts [1 pts]

Checks the task state counters are tallied accurately

### Subtest 01: Comparing against fake procfs test set
```

> Assertion: tstats != NULL [  OK  ]

> Assertion: tstats->running == 2 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: tstats->waiting == 3 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: tstats->sleeping == 1479 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: tstats->stopped == 2 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: tstats->zombie == 1 [  OK  ]

--> Subtest passed
```

### Subtest 02: Comparing against the tiny 'dummyproc' test set
```

> Assertion: tstats != NULL [  OK  ]

> Assertion: tstats->running == 0 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: tstats->waiting == 1 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: tstats->sleeping == 5 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: tstats->stopped == 0 [  OK  ]

> Assertion: tstats->zombie == 0 [  OK  ]

--> Subtest passed
```
